## 🚀 About Me
Hi, I’m Luke — a backend‑focused software developer based in Hamilton, New Zealand. I specialize in building **scalable systems**, **secure configurations**, and **clean workflows** using technologies like **.NET**, **SQL**, **Azure**, and **React Native**.

I love solving real‑world problems through structured code and automation. Whether it’s optimizing performance, navigating complex environments like Xamarin, or designing intuitive dashboards, I bring clarity, curiosity, and precision to every project.

Outside of development, I’m committed to community service through volunteer work in retail, hospice, and digital support roles.
